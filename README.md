# A radial-velocity investigation of CoRoT-7

This repository contains the data, code and results from the paper 

_A radial-velocity investigation of the CoRoT-7 planetary system_ by Jo√£o Faria et al.

### CoRoT-7 data

The HARPS radial-velocity observations are in the file [`CCCCCC.txt`](https://github.com/j-faria/exoBD-CoRoT7/blob/master/corot7.txt)

### birth-death MCMC

The code used to sample from the joint posterior distribution and calculate the evidence of the model can be found [here](https://github.com/eggplantbren/Exoplanet/tree/gp_quasiperiodic_noise)

### Results

The input parameters and complete output analysed in the paper are available in this repository, in the following files:

- `OPTIONS`: the input option to DNest3
- `run.txt`: the log of the run
- `sample.txt`, `sample_info.txt`, `levels.txt`: step-by-step output with samples from the mixture of constrained priors and the diffusive nested smapling levels
- `posterior_sample.txt`: samples from the joint posterior distribution
